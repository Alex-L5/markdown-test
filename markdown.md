"Tablet Wireframes")

[Desktop Wireframes](http://www.desktopwireframes.com 
"Desktop Wireframes")

[Back to top](http://www.backtotop.com)

## Design Choices

### Typography

The font family chosen for the Brazilian Fan Page was [Lato](http://www.lato.com "Lato"). It is a sans-serif font with a rounded appearance and a modern feel. Lato also has a clean and easy-to-read style, making it suitable for both print and web design.

### Colour Scheme
The color scheme chosen based on the background image. All the colours are cool toned to match the yellow, blue and white image theme. 



I have also used [Contrast Grid](http://www.contrastgrid.com "Contrast Grid") to get inspiration for possible colour combination to make the website visually appealing.



### Images

Background image is generated by [Gencraft](http://www.gencraft.com "Gencraft"). It displays cartoon characters with cool yellow and blue colors in order not to distract from the content of the quiz questions. The aim was for the background image to complement the subject matter of the quiz.

### Responsiveness

My website is responsive to different layouts depending on the size of the viewport have been included in the CSS media queries. This allows visitors to experience the website as I intended on device types and screen sizes. The breakpoints I am using are from Bootstrap.

[Back to top](http://www.backtotop.com)

# Features
Layout is easy to use and adheres to the best practices in formatting and styling. Participants can easily navigate between questions and access additional features such as sports paraphernalia and contact information. With various questions and real-time feedback on right and wrong responses, the fan page offers users an engaging experience. This interactive feature increases user engagement and motivates users to take knowledge tests.

## Existing Features


### Header
This webpage has a browser window consistent across all screen sizes. The signup buttons and send buttons are the same styles as all the other buttons on the page. The headings are grey color so they blend in well and do not distract the fans.

All buttons have hover effect and signup buttons have active color as well. Username and Difficulty Levels are required fields in order to proceed to the next part of the quiz. Once they are selected, questions are Google based. This feature accommodates users with varying levels of knowledge and expertise in the Brazilian national team and Brazilian culture.

# Testing

## Bugs

The quiz was thoroughly tested. I have recorded the manual testing in other parts of this document. I have used console logs to ensure JavaScript is running as expected in the background. 3 major bugs were identified and rectified. 2 bugs are still unresolved and require further investigation:

Bug	Status	Description	Steps To Resolve
Player Scores array not updating	Fixed	New player scores not adding to the player score array. The same 5 scores displaying all the time.	Wrong method used. Score was being added to the ed of Array which is fixed size. Updated JS code to add score to the beginning of Array and sort the scores accordingly.
Infinite Timer	Fixed	While testing using console logs, transpired that timer keeps running after the game is finished and until Play Again is clicked.	Moved startTimer function into get new question so when no questions are displayed the timer will not start.
Progress Dots Missing	Fixed	The aim for the functionality is to display correct answers in green, wrong - red, timed out - grey. While testing noticed that it does not add a dot for timed out answer.	Added a function to updateProgressDot ('empty') when the time is up.
Skip Question	Unresolved	There is a 2 second setTimeOut after question is answered and new question is displayed. However, if the question is answered with one second left on the timer, both timer functionality  and time out seem to run concurrently. This sometimes results in skipping a question in the quiz. The question is counted as unanswered.	This requires further testing of the JS and possibly redesign of startTimer function.
Console Error - SEND button	Unresolved	When feedback form button SEND is clicked, console error appears in console. Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')
    at HTMLDocument. It does not affect the functionality of the form as the acknowledgement page still displays.	There two forms being used in html file and button types are clashing. It needs additional JS event listeners to handle the SEND button. This was out of scope for this part of the project as the form is not being handled in the backend.

## Responsiveness Tests

To test the responsiveness, I have launched the website very early on. I followed the mobile-first strategy and verified all of my modifications using the DevTools browsers for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. Deployed versions were tested using the external website [Responsive Design Checker](http://www.responsivedesignchecker.com "Responsive Design Checker"). The [Am I Responsive](http://www.theamiresponsive.com "Am I Responsive") website was another external source that was used to obtain a unified view of different device breakpoints.

I have also used Google Chrome's Mobile Simulator extension to evaluate the responsiveness of even more specialized devices. Device samples were examined for navigation, element alignment, content layout, and functionality concerns at different breakpoints. I moved the hamburger icon from the left to the right to enhance user experience as a result of the testing.

Final Test Results:

Size	Device Example	Navigation	Element Alignments	Content Placement	Functionality	Notes
sm	Samsung Galaxy S20	Good	Good	Good	Good	
sm	iPhone 11 PRO	Good	Good	Good	Good	Updated font size of the start area
sm	iPhone 13 PRO MAX	Good	Good	Good	Good	Updated header bottom margin to fit quiz container
md	iPad MINI	Good	Good	Good	Good	
md	Galaxy Tab S7	Good	Good	Good	Good	
md	iPad Air	Good	Good	Good	Good	
lg	iPad Pro	Good	Good	Good	Good	
xl	Mackbook Air	Good	Good	Good	Good	
xl	HP Stream Laptop	Good	Good	Good	Good	
xxl	Dell Lattitude	Good	Good	Good	Good	Updated font weight for support headings
xxl	Desktop	Good	Good	Good	Good

## Browser Testing

The Fan Page website was examined for bugs and malfunctions using a variety of browsers. Opera, Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge were selected for thorough testing. Additionally, I have registered with [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com) in order to test my page on both Safari and Internet Explorer. Due to its age, Internet Explorer's initial results were quite subpar. On an iPad and an iPhone, I tested Safari. For the website's final version, no significant problems were discovered on the top 4 browsers. The test findings were verified.
